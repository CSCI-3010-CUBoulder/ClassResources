CSCI 3010: Programming Project Workshop: Object-Oriented Programming
=====================

See the [Canvas website](https://canvas.colorado.edu/courses/99867) for the syllabus, assignments, and in-class activities materials.  
  
We will be intermittently adding notes and other resources to this repository to help support the material that we cover in this class, which we will frequently link to from the canvas website. 

Recommended workflow:
---------------
1. Clone this repository (`git clone https://github.com/CSCI-3010-CUBoulder/ClassResources.git`)
2. Do a `git pull` when your repository has gone stale (there are changes/resources here that you do not have locally).
3. We recommend not editing the files in this repository, but if you do, you may want to make a copy of the file to avoid any merge conflicts later if we add to/update the document!
